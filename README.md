# 🦁 CGC Smart-Eat: AI-Powered Canteen & Health Manager

> **Submission for TechSprint Hackathon (Google Technologies)** > 

## 🚀 Overview
**CGC Smart-Eat** is not just a food ordering app; it is a **Smart Lifestyle Coach** for students. 

In college campuses like CGC Landran, students often face two problems:
1.  Long waiting queues at canteens (Nescafe, Subway, Main Mess).
2.  Unhealthy eating habits leading to fitness issues.

This project solves both by integrating **Google Gemini AI** directly into the food ordering flow. It gamifies nutrition—rewarding healthy choices and assigning "Recovery Tasks" for junk food.

A centralized dashboard to switch between different campus outlets:
- **Nescafe:** Coffee, Maggi, Sandwiches.
- **Subway:** Subs, Salads.
